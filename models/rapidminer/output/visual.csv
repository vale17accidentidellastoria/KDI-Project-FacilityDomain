"WILDLIFE","compreso nel biglietto d'ingresso MUSE","​; La prima mostra italiana dello scultore tedesco Jürgen Lingl-Rebetez, che ritrae con una originale tecnica di intaglio specie animali tanto carismatiche quanto fragili.; Inaugurazione 14 giugno ore 18 con l'artista, letture tratte da Pinocchio a cura della lettrice Ester D’Amico e accompagnamento con violino a cura di Andrea Ferroni.; Più di 30 sculture sono raccolte in quattro nuclei tematici. Accanto al pantheon selvaggio dei Grandi Carnivori trovano spazio i gruppi delle specie artiche, di ambienti temperati, infine un angolo dove l'autore concede il suo tributo artistico e passionale al cavallo, un animale di sicuro non minacciato ma che l'uomo va lentamente 'dimenticando' dopo averlo reso un elemento cardine della sua storia.; La visita alla mostra si connota in primis come un'esperienza estetica ed emozionale, supportata dalla grandiosità delle opere esposte, ma le informazioni a corredo delle specie rappresentate permettono di approfondire anche lo stato di conservazione, il presente complesso e il futuro fosco di questi spettacolari compagni di viaggio.; Dietro l'eccellenza del risultato c'è la profonda conoscenza anatomica di Rebetez, che ha memorizzato e fatto propri i rapporti dimensionali, le proporzioni e le armonie tra corpi e crani, mandibole e mascelle, occhi e narici, e li ripropone sulla superficie scabra del legno aggredito dalla motosega.; L'artista; Jürgen Lingl-Rebetez è un artista tedesco, nato nel 1971 in Baviera; la passione per il disegno e la pittura dei più svariati soggetti (animali, persone e paesaggi), intensa in lui fin dall'infanzia, lo portò, all'età di 20 anni, alla prima esibizione dei suoi studi artistici di nudo presso una galleria d'arte di Dachau.; Successivamente si specializzò in scultura lignea grazie a un apprendistato presso il maestro Hans-Joachim Seitfudem, per poi trasferirsi in Svizzera nel 1996 e diventare un artista indipendente, incominciando a esplorare le potenzialità espressive della motosega. Oggi, le opere di Jürgen Lingl-Rebetez, poi trasferitosi in Francia dal 1999, sono esposte in collezioni pubbliche e private in tutta Europa, USA, Canada, Russia, Australia, Singapore e Hong Kong.","https://www.muse.it/it/Esplora/mostre-temporanee/Archivio/Pagine/Wildlife-mostra-Rebetez-2019-2020.aspx",,,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Muse",,"2019-06-15","2020-01-12",,,"[]","[]","[]",,

"Berlino 2019, a 30 anni dalla caduta del muro","Gratis","Una mostra alle Gallerie di Piedicastello per ricordare i 30 anni da un evento che ha cambiato la storia: la caduta del muro di Berlino.; Il progetto è del fotografo Tommaso Bonaventura, in collabroazione con la curatrice Elisa Del Prete.; La mostra propone il racconto del Begrüssungsgeld, il denaro di benvenuto che dal 1970 al dicembre 1989 i cittadini della DDR ricevevano quando entravano nella Germania Ovest per la prima volta. Questa vicenda offre uno spunto per interrogarsi su un cambiamento epocale a partire da un punto di osservazione che privilegia le storie private e familiari, restituendole attraverso un duplice racconto: fotografico e video.; La semplice domanda «Ricordi come hai speso il tuo Begrüssungsgeld?» posta a un campione di tedeschi della ex DDR di generazioni differenti, intervistati nel corso del 2018 e 2019, ha rappresentato il punto di partenza per un viaggio nella memoria, oggi ancora poco condivisa, di queste persone che hanno vissuto un cambiamento totale, sia da un punto di vista materiale, lavorativo, sociale ed economico, sia politico.; Se la caduta del muro di Berlino ha posto le basi per un nuovo assetto politico e geografico mondiale segnando la fine della Guerra Fredda, la riunificazione tra Germania Est e Germania Ovest rimane ancora oggi un fenomeno complesso e poco discusso nei suoi aspetti più profondi. Spesso risolto in modo semplicistico come il coronamento di uno scontato desiderio di libertà, il superamento del confine fisico che simbolicamente coincide con l’abbattimento del muro porta inevitabilmente con sé la necessità di superare anche un confine ideologico.; Il 9 novembre 1989 non cade soltanto il muro di Berlino ma cambia un intero paese: la parte che si ricongiunge alle sue origini subisce una inevitabile metamorfosi e svaniscono rapidamente un modo di vivere, di pensare, di comportarsi, di vestire, di spendere. In tempi brevissimi la Repubblica Democratica Tedesca è rimossa dall'immaginario e dalla memoria. Quasi 17 milioni di persone si trovano di colpo immerse in un nuovo stile di vita, dove non valgono più le regole apprese fino ad allora. La trasformazione è repentina. Nelle politiche governative e nella vita quotidiana delle persone si afferma il nuovo alfabeto dell'Ovest, i suoi colori, i suoi odori, le sue politiche economiche e sociali, e quelle che erano due comunità distinte si trovano a convivere.; Il racconto fotografico di Tommaso Bonaventura, intrecciandosi alla narrazione di queste biografie, si propone di restituire una Berlino contemporanea fatta di volti, luoghi e storie non scontati, rimasta simbolo di uno degli eventi più significativi della storia recente, ancora viva e presente nel tessuto cittadino, urbano e sociale. La ricerca si è infatti focalizzata su Berlino quale emblema di questo cambiamento, ma anche città in cui la presenza fisica e 'mentale' del muro, che ha segnato così fortemente l'esperienza delle persone, in qualche modo permane.","http://www.trentotoday.it/eventi/muro-berlino-30-anni-2019.html",,,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Le%20Gallerie%20Piedicastello%3B%20Via%20D%C3%B2s%20Trento",,"2019-11-09","2020-02-09","09:00:00","18:00:00",,,,,

Dall'alluvione del '66 al racconto sui social’ è realizzata dalla Fondazione Museo storico del Trentino e sarà visitabile per un mese presso le Gallerie di Piedicastello, a partire da sabato 26 ottobre 2019, giorno della commemorazione per Vaia a Trento.; L'installazione si compone di sei filmati. A sinistra quelli dedicati all'alluvione del 1966 e realizzati utilizzando immagini super 8. Ognuno dei tre video riguarda uno specifico tema: l'allagamento della città di Trento, la devastazione nelle Valli che di fatto pagarono il prezzo più alto in termini di vittime e distruzione, e 'il dopo' con la conta dei danni e il lavoro per ripristinare il territorio.; A destra i filmati su Vaia, la tempesta che colpì il Trentino e non solo tra il 29 e il 30 ottobre 2018.

"Pellicole in mostra, come si filmava una volta","Gratis","Un viaggio nella storia fino a maggio 2020 in esposizione alle Gallerie di Piedicastello. Documenti catturati dalla cinepresa, un'azione che appartiene al passato. Forse non ancora al passato remoto, ma comunque prima dell'arrivo del digitale. Nell'era delle pellicole “riprendere” o essere “ripresi” è stata un'esperienza comune a molti. Esperienza e gesto che è alla “preistoria” di quello che oggi ripetiamo continuamente, usando lo smartphone.; I formati ridotti indicano le pellicole realizzate in ambito non professionale a partire dagli anni venti fino agli anni ottanta del Novecento. Un campo molto vasto di produzioni filmiche, che vanno dal cinema di famiglia per uso domestico al documentario. Dal punto di visto storico diventano preziosi strumenti per cogliere i cambiamenti dei riti sociali, i modelli di comportamento, le trasformazioni del territorio del secolo scorso. Le storie in formato ridotto incontrano così la “grande Storia”.; Le pellicole sono conservate dalla Fondazione Museo storico del Trentino nella sua Cineteca e questa esposizione vuole essere un invito a valorizzare un patrimonio, a renderlo fruibile per il pubblico. I Musei servono anche a questo. Le Gallerie a mettere in scena tutto ciò.; VISITE GUIDATE GRATUITE; domenica 29 settembre 2019, ore 15.30; domenica 27 ottobre 2019, ore 15.30; domenica 24 novembre 2019, ore 15.30; domenica 29 dicembre 2019, ore 15.30; ORARI; Da martedì a domenica, ore 9.00-18.00.

"Mart Open Day: ingresso gratuito","Gratis","Il Mart Open Day è da sempre un momento di festa e di condivisione. La prima domenica del mese con ingresso gratuito è un’occasione unica per partecipare a tante attività e sperimentare differenti modalità di visita al museo. Al naturale compito di conservazione e trasmissione del patrimonio culturale si è affiancato negli ultimi anni un ruolo sempre più importante dei musei come luoghi di aggregazione e di partecipazione, che rispettino l’inclusione e valorizzino il talento di tutti i cittadini. Al Mart, tra i programmi di lungo periodo portati avanti con continuità, spiccano i Progetti speciali, destinati a persone con disabilità e pensati per i visitatori la cui fruizione va mediata e sostenuta con particolare cura. Il Mart dedica l’Open Day di dicembre ai temi dell’inclusione e della valorizzazione delle diversità, anticipando la Giornata Internazionale delle Persone con Disabilità del 3 dicembre.; Nel programma dell’Open Day sono inseriti numerosi incontri. Dalle ore 10.00 alle ore 11.00 verrà presentata in Sala Conferenze la guida cartacea realizzata con la Comunicazione Aumentativa Alternativa, un linguaggio che favorisce l’accesso ad alcune opere delle Collezioni a un pubblico con bisogni complessi. Questa traduzione elimina le barriere culturali e fisiche e inserisce le persone con disabilità in un percorso di arricchimento personale. La guida è realizzata in collaborazione con le cooperative sociali Il Ponte e Iter nell’ambito del progetto Le vie dell’arte. La conferenza sarà tradotta in LIS a cura dell’Ente Nazionale Sordi di Trento.; Alle 11.30 nelle sale espositive si potrà assistere a un talk con i partecipanti dell’Inclusive Practice Workshop, un laboratorio di danza inclusiva di quattro giorni organizzato dal Centro internazionale della Danza e Oriente Occidente Dance Festival. Tenuto dal danzatore non vedente Giuseppe Comuniello, da Camilla Guarino e dalla britannica Stopgag Dance company, l’ultimo giorno di workshop vede i partecipanti svolgere le prove libere nelle sale del museo, con orario 10.00-12.00 e 14.00-16.00. Il talk delle 11.30, traduzione in LIS a cura di Ente Nazionale Sordi di Trento, sarà un momento di dialogo aperto con i danzatori e le danzatrici nell’ottica della condivisione e della piena inclusione delle persone con disabilità.; Inoltre, dalle 10.00 alle 17.00, l’Area educazione si trasformerà in uno spazio espositivo con presentazione al pubblico alle 14.30. Protagonisti i lavori realizzati durante i laboratori condotti al Mart con la cooperativa sociale Eliodoro di Riva del Garda. La cooperativa sociale Villa Maria, infine, si occuperà dell’accoglienza in sala per Les silences éternels de ces espaces infinis, concerto per pianoforte di Franco Venturini nell’ambito della rassegna Mart Music in collaborazione con l’Associazione Filarmonica di Rovereto.; La partecipazione alle attività è gratuita e senza prenotazione.","http://www.trentotoday.it/eventi/mart-gratis-domenica-1-dicembre.html",,,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Mart%20-%20Museo%20di%20Arte%20Moderna%20e%20Contemporanea%3B%20Corso%20Bettini%3B%20Rovereto",,"2019-12-01","2019-12-01","00:00:00","23:59:00",,,,,

"Human Rights? #Clima",,"International Exhibition of Contemporary Art: 167 ARTISTS FROM 35 COUNTRIES RAISE AN URGENT ALARM: SAVE THE WORLD!. UNRIC Agenda 2030 says about the climate change: “Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.. To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.”. AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of “HUMAN RIGHTS?” on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let’s stop thinking “it’s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world”! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.. Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.. What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people’s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to “together we can.”HUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to ‘return’ art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message.

"Tuuumultum!",,"Curated by Nicoletta Boschiero and Duccio Dogheria. The exhibition examines the relationship between art and music in the 20th century, comparing specific historical periods. It begins with the Futurists' exploration of sound, from the manifestos of Russolo and Pratella to Depero’s onomalinguistic works. Starting from the futurist spark, the exhibition moves on to explore the noise music of the second half of the century, including Sound Poetry and experimental music.The works of art on exhibit - from Veronesi to Chiari by way of Kandinsky’s watercolours and on to the contemporary artists Spanghero and Mazzonelli - dialogue with materials from the Mart Archivio del ’900: graphic works, documents, artists' books, phonograph records, posters, videos, and audio recordings.Source: http://www.mart.tn.it/tuuumultum-en","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/631848",,,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Rovereto%2C%20%2C%20Depero%20%20Futurist%20House%20of%20the%20Arts",,"2019-12-02","2019-12-02","18:00:00",,,,,,
"The changing of eternity","free admission","Ten years ago, UNESCO declared our mountains a World Heritage Site. This exhibition is part of the events organised on the occasion of this anniversary, as a result of the collaboration between Trentino Marketing and Trento Film Festival.This project was born thanks to an intuition shared by the authors, Luca Chistè, sociologist and photographer, and Terri Maffei Gueret, creative talent and graphic, daughter of Mountain Guide Clemente Maffei Gueret. The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chistè.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers. As a result, the interaction between image and word helps us to reflect even more on the relationship between man and nature.As Henry David Thoreau used to say: 'The perception of beauty is a moral test'.","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/632637",,,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Palazzo%20Roccabruna",,"2019-12-02","2019-12-02","08:30:00","12:00:00",,,,,

"The changing of eternity","free admission","Ten years ago, UNESCO declared our mountains a World Heritage Site. This exhibition is part of the events organised on the occasion of this anniversary, as a result of the collaboration between Trentino Marketing and Trento Film Festival.This project was born thanks to an intuition shared by the authors, Luca Chistè, sociologist and photographer, and Terri Maffei Gueret, creative talent and graphic, daughter of Mountain Guide Clemente Maffei Gueret. The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chistè.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers. As a result, the interaction between image and word helps us to reflect even more on the relationship between man and nature.As Henry David Thoreau used to say: 'The perception of beauty is a moral test'.","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/632637",,,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Palazzo%20Roccabruna",,"2019-12-04","2019-12-04","08:30:00","12:00:00",,,,,

"Human Rights? #Clima",,"International Exhibition of Contemporary Art: 167 ARTISTS FROM 35 COUNTRIES RAISE AN URGENT ALARM: SAVE THE WORLD!. UNRIC Agenda 2030 says about the climate change: “Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.. To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.”. AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of “HUMAN RIGHTS?” on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let’s stop thinking “it’s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world”! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.. Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.. What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people’s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to “together we can.”HUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest.

"Human Rights? #Clima",,"International Exhibition of Contemporary Art: 167 ARTISTS FROM 35 COUNTRIES RAISE AN URGENT ALARM: SAVE THE WORLD!. UNRIC Agenda 2030 says about the climate change: “Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.. To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.”. AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of “HUMAN RIGHTS?” on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let’s stop thinking “it’s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world”! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.. Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.. What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people’s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to “together we can.”HUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to ‘return’ art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message. To the artists the task of speaking of great challenges.

"Human Rights? #Clima",,"International Exhibition of Contemporary Art: 167 ARTISTS FROM 35 COUNTRIES RAISE AN URGENT ALARM: SAVE THE WORLD!. UNRIC Agenda 2030 says about the climate change: “Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.. To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.”. AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of “HUMAN RIGHTS?” on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let’s stop thinking “it’s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world”! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.. Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.. What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people’s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to “together we can.”HUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to ‘return’ art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message.

"Human Rights? #Clima",,"International Exhibition of Contemporary Art: 167 ARTISTS FROM 35 COUNTRIES RAISE AN URGENT ALARM: SAVE THE WORLD!. UNRIC Agenda 2030 says about the climate change: “Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.. To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.”. AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of “HUMAN RIGHTS?” on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let’s stop thinking “it’s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world”! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.. Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.. What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people’s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to “together we can.”HUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone.

"Human Rights? #Clima",,"International Exhibition of Contemporary Art: 167 ARTISTS FROM 35 COUNTRIES RAISE AN URGENT ALARM: SAVE THE WORLD!. UNRIC Agenda 2030 says about the climate change: “Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.. To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.”. AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of “HUMAN RIGHTS?” on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let’s stop thinking “it’s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world”! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.. Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.. What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people’s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to “together we can.”HUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone.

"Human Rights? #Clima",,"International Exhibition of Contemporary Art: 167 ARTISTS FROM 35 COUNTRIES RAISE AN URGENT ALARM: SAVE THE WORLD!. UNRIC Agenda 2030 says about the climate change: “Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.. To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.”. AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of “HUMAN RIGHTS?” on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let’s stop thinking “it’s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world”! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.. Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.. What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people’s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to “together we can.”HUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone.

"Human Rights? #Clima",,"International Exhibition of Contemporary Art: 167 ARTISTS FROM 35 COUNTRIES RAISE AN URGENT ALARM: SAVE THE WORLD!. UNRIC Agenda 2030 says about the climate change: “Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.. Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.. To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.”. AIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of “HUMAN RIGHTS?” on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let’s stop thinking “it’s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world”! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.. Art can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.. What artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people’s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to “together we can.”HUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone.

Starting from the futurist spark, the exhibition moves on to explore the noise music of the second half of the century, including Sound Poetry and experimental music.The works of art on exhibit - from Veronesi to Chiari by way of Kandinsky’s watercolours and on to the contemporary artists Spanghero and Mazzonelli - dialogue with materials from the Mart Archivio del ’900: graphic works, documents, artists' books, phonograph records, posters, videos, and audio recordings.Source: http://www.mart.tn.it/tuuumultum-en","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/631848",,,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Rovereto%2C%20%2C%20Depero%20%20Futurist%20House%20of%20the%20Arts",,"2020-01-16","2020-01-16","18:00:00",,,,,,
