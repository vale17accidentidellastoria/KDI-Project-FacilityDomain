"Una notte sbagliata ( A wrong night)",,"Narrator of refined intelligence, Marco Baliani returns to the scene with Una notte sbagliata, a polyphonic monologue in which he investigates the dark zone of violence. The story of a street man and his torturers, at the same time defenders of order and authors of a senseless beating, is interwoven with the actor's autobiography and with a complex artistic and human reflection. Not just a case of chronicle but an unanswered question: where do we want to stand? A wrong nightby and with Marco Balianidirected by Maria Magliettascenes, lights, videos Lucio Dianasound landscapes Mirto BalianiStefania Cempini costumesdrawings Marco Balianiproduction Brands Theatre(Translation by Alexia Vozzo, Sophie M.

"Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo @InDanza","For further information see the official website http://www.centrosantachiara.it/IT/infoInDTn19-20/","Founded in New York more than 40 years ago, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, or simply 'The Trocks' as they are called in the Anglo-Saxon world, are a worldwide phenomenon. Their impertinent, hilarious and yet philological performances in relation to the great repertoire of classical ballet are appreciated by critics as well as by the wider and more popular public.The company consists of eighteen male dancers who are transformed from time to time in the protagonists - including female roles - of the most significant ballet repertoire of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The aim: to parody the tradition with amazing irony, great technical skill and deep historical knowledge. Their carnet of titles is vast and includes famous ballets and Russian goodies for amateurs. There will also be, in the new European tour that touches Trento and Bolzano, the hilarious second act of Swan Lake by Lev Ivanov (the famous pas de quatre of the great swans), the neoclassical Go for Barocco by George Balanchine, the intense and tear-jerking/ tearful Death of the Swan, famous solo composed by Michail Fokin for Anna Pavlova on the music of Camille Saint-Saëns and a brilliant Walpurgisnacht reconstructed from the version of Elena Kunikova's Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow by Leonid Lavrovsky, baldly danced to the notes of Charles Gounod's Faust.Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte CarloSwan Lake Act IIPas deux or modern,Pas de quatreDying swan Artistic Director/ Künstlerischer Leiter Tory DobrinAssociate Director / Assoiziierter Direktor Isabel Martinez RiveraGeneral Manager / General Manager Liz Harler(Translation by Alexia Vozzo, Sophie M.

"Overload",,"A goldfish can keep its attention on a continuous basis for just two seconds. And the man? Immersed in the contemporary hyperbombardment of signs, even the human being risks not being able to concentrate on the emotions of others. Starting with the personal and artistic drama of American writer David Foster Wallace, the Underground presents an adrenaline-fuelled game of mental links that connect to each other, and in which the public is also called upon to participate actively.
