"Transiti, al Sanbapolis grande musica","10 euro","Divenuta negli ultimi cinque anni una delle proposte musicali di punta del Centro Servizi Culturali S. Chiara, torna anche in questa stagione TRANSITI – Musiche in movimento. La rassegna, curata da Alberto Campo, sarà strutturata su sei appuntamenti (da ottobre a marzo presso il Teatro SanbàPolis di Trento), mantenendo intatti i propositi iniziali che le hanno permesso di ritagliarsi un ruolo nelle abitudini cultuali del pubblico trentino: indagare l’attualità musicale senza porsi limiti di genere o geografia, mettendo in scena sia interpreti portatori di linguaggi innovativi sia figure dotate di rilievo storico. Il calendario degli eventi è stato illustrato questa mattina nel corso di una conferenza stampa da Francesco Nardelli, direttore del Centro Servizi Culturali S. Chiara, e Alberto Campo, consulente artistico, alla presenza di Corrado Bungaro, assessore alla Cultura del Comune di Trento.; Il programma prenderà il via venerdì 11 ottobre con THE NECKS, band australiana di culto riverita su scala planetaria, in attività da tre decenni abbondanti. “Un’ossessione” per lo scrittore Geoff Dyer, intenditore e appassionato di jazz, come testimoniò il suo libro più celebre, “Natura morta con custodia di sax”, che due anni fa sul “New York Times” li ha definiti “il migliore trio sulla faccia della Terra”. Si tratta tuttavia di jazz sui generis, per certi versi affine al minimalismo colto e per altri alle avanguardie del rock. Da quest’ultimo ambito proviene del resto il pianista Chris Abrahams, associatosi nel sottobosco indipendente di Sidney con il bassista Lloyd Swanton e il batterista Tony Buck. Autori fin qui di una ventina di dischi, dal vivo si avventurano nell’improvvisazione sui canoni impressi in sala di registrazione creando astratte e suggestive musiche d’atmosfera.; Nell’arco di una carriera lunga oltre 40 anni il 68enne BILL FRISELL, atteso a Trento giovedì 24 ottobre, si è imposto quale assoluto protagonista della scena musicale statunitense: status certificato nel 2005 dal Grammy Award assegnato al suo album “Unspeakable”. Compositore e arrangiatore, ma soprattutto chitarrista sopraffino, dopo essere affiorato dal circuito off del jazz newyorkese entrò nei ranghi della celeberrima etichetta discografica bavarese Ecm, allargando poi nel tempo il raggio della propria azione creativa fino ad abbracciare la tradizione del folklore americano del Novecento. Trae ispirazione proprio da essa il progetto Harmony, titolo dell’imminente album targato Blue Note, in cui suona accompagnato da Petra Haden (figlia di Charlie, leggendario contrabbassista jazz, in voce), Hank Roberts (violoncello) e Luke Bergman (chitarra baritona), per dare forma a ciò che oltreoceano un commentatore ha chiamato “musica sacra”.; Il cartellone della rassegna propone quindi venerdì 15 novembre un’occasione forse unica e irripetibile. Preceduta dal disco uscito in estate, che mutua il titolo dal classico “hard boiled” di Raymond Chandler “The Long Goodbye”, potrebbe essere la tournée con cui i PERE UBU si accommiatano definitivamente dal proprio pubblico dopo un’avventura artistica gloriosa, ispirata originariamente – come dichiarava il nome scelto – all’Ubu Roi; antieroe “patafisico” creato dal simbolista francese Alfred Jarry. Presentando l’album, David Thomas - fondatore e leader della band di Cleveland, archetipo monumentale del post punk statunitense - ha affermato: «È un riepilogo di tutte le storie e le canzoni proposte in modi differenti dai Pere Ubu nell’arco di 40 e passa anni che fornisce risposte alle domande formulate da noi stessi durante questo tempo, consegnandole a quella che io considero sia la loro destinazione definitiva».; Com’è consuetudine, anche quest’anno il programma include un appuntamento con la sonorizzazione originale di un film muto, onorando sabato 1 febbraio la memoria di Carl Theodor Dreyer, rappresentato da un caposaldo della sua produzione: “Vampyr”, horror d’impronta surrealista realizzato dal regista danese nel 1932, subito dopo “La passione di Giovanna d’Arco”, e divenuto nel tempo oggetto di culto. A musicarlo dal vivo saranno i quotati strumentisti torinesi PAOLO SPACCAMONTI (chitarra e sintetizzatore) e RAMON MORO (tromba e flicorno), già in coppia nel 2016 per la colonna sonora de “I cormorani” di Fabio Bobbio, insieme alla violoncellista canadese JULIA KENT, anni fa nella formazione dei Johnsons che affiancava Antony Hegarty: artista abituata a sconfinare in ambito cinematografico (un suo brano figurava in “This Must Be the Place” di Paolo Sorrentino), nonché verso la danza e il teatro.; Il penultimo appuntamento è in calendario venerdì 28 febbraio e vedrà protagonista RICHARD DAWSON, artista del genere che noi chiameremmo cantautore, benché il suo stile tenda evidentemente altrove. Suonando la chitarra in maniera bizzarra e articolando un timbro di voce lunatico, fra Robert Wyatt e Syd Barrett, anche se lui sostiene d’ispirarsi al canto devozionale sufi detto “qawwali” e al folk inglese d’antan, si è guadagnato nel novembre 2014 la copertina dell’autorevole mensile “The Wire” e il peana di “The Guardian” per l’album uscito nel 2017, “Peasant”: “Astruso eppure stranamente accessibile, di ricerca ma azzeccato, un vero successo”. Era il quinto atto in una serie avviata nel 2007, quando ancora lavorava da commesso in un negozio di dischi di Newcastle e strimpellava una sgangherata chitarra acustica dalle corde di nylon: il prossimo, “2020” è atteso in ottobre.; Transiti si concluderà venerdì 27 marzo mettendo in scena una suggestiva osmosi fra musica e immagini: questo offre il progetto chiamato JERUSALEM IN MY HEART, di cui sono responsabili il filmmaker canadese Charles-André Coderre e dal pluristrumentista e cantante di origine libanese Radwan Ghazi Moumneh, contitolare del leggendario studio di registrazione Hotel2Tango. Combinando sonorità in cui echi della tradizione araba fluttuano in ambienti elettronici a proiezioni di diapositive e video in 16 millimetri, il duo esplora una dimensione audiovisiva dalle qualità oniriche. Destinato inizialmente alla creazione di performance a soggetto, solo in un secondo tempo il lavoro degli artisti di Montréal è stato cristallizzato su disco, cosa accaduta ancora lo scorso anno con “Daqa’iq Tudaik”, terzo album della serie, edito come i precedenti dall’influente etichetta locale Constellation.; Il biglietto d’ingresso per ciascun appuntamento è in vendita a 10 Euro, con una riduzione a 8 per gli Under 26 e a 5 per gli studenti universitari.","http://www.trentotoday.it/eventi/transiti-2019-centro-santa-chiara-sanbapolis.html",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Teatro%20Sanbapolis%3B%20Via%20della%20Malpensada",,"11/10/2019","25/03/2020","21",,,,,,

"La stagione di Teatro tra la Grande Prosa e altre tendenze","Prezzo non disponibile","Da sempre palcoscenico per i “grandi” del teatro, anche in questa nuova stagione la Grande Prosa manterrà intatta la propria vocazione, ospitando celebri autori del passato, messi a confronto con autori affermati del teatro contemporaneo, e alcuni tra i volti più noti del palcoscenico e del grande schermo come Alessandro Haber, Anna Foglietta, Paolo Calabresi, Sergio Rubini, Luigi Lo Cascio, Elio De Capitani e Natalino Balasso, tra gli altri. Il compito di aprire e chiudere la rassegna spetterà però a due progetti fortemente legati alla territorialità trentina, che vedranno coinvolti l’attore Andrea Castelli (in chiusura di Stagione, al Teatro Cuminetti) e la compagnia trentina OHT | Office for a Human Theatre. Quest’ultima, in particolare, esordirà con un progetto dedicato alla tragedia che nel 1985 ha colpito la Val di Stava e l’intera comunità trentina. Ma una ulteriore novità caratterizzerà la nuova Stagione: «19 LUGLIO 1985», questo il titolo del progetto incentrato sulla catastrofe avvenuta in Val di Fiemme – che sarà accompagnato da una mostra allestita presso lo Spazio Archeologico del SAS - sarà infatti lo spettacolo che inaugurerà anche la rassegna rivolta alle opere più sperimentali e alternative della scena nazionale.; Entrambe le stagioni Grande Prosa e Altre Tendenze incominceranno quindi con il medesimo spettacolo al Teatro Sociale (e non più al “Cuminetti”), a sottolineare il legame tra le diverse forme e possibilità del teatro e la capacità della scena di farsi luogo di riflessione dei grandi temi del contemporaneo.; “19 LUGLIO 1985” è una produzione originale di OHT, in coproduzione con il Centro Santa Chiara e Roma Europa Festival, e con la collaborazione di Centrale Fies e la Fondazione Stava 1985. A quasi 35 anni dalla colata di fango che cancellò una valle e, con essa, centinaia di vite umane, Filippo Andreatta con il supporto drammaturgico di Marco Bernardi guarda a quell’episodio come momento epifanico del rapporto uomo - montagna e lo celebra in una “tragedia alpina”. Sullo sfondo dei paesaggi della Val di Stava, il Coro Continuum diretto dal Maestro Luigi Azzolini accompagnerà la narrazione con un prezioso commento musicale. La proposta della Grande Prosa prosegue con un grande classico del teatro francese. In “LA SCUOLA DELLE MOGLI” , il napoletano Arturo Cirillo rilegge la commedia di Molière (in chiave moderna), raccontando la storia di come l’amore sia la sola chiave della felicità umana. Dicembre sarà il turno della commedia italiana con una produzione del Teatro Stabile di Bolzano, con in scena l’amatissimo Natalino Balasso per la regia di Serena Sinigaglia e la riscrittura drammaturgia di Vitaliano Trevisan. “LA BANCAROTTA” , testo poco conosciuto di Goldoni, fotografa con ironia il personaggio di un imprenditore sull’orlo del fallimento e dei vizi che l’hanno portato a dissipare denaro e relazioni personali. Il 2020 inizierà con il ritorno della coppia Luigi Lo Cascio - Sergio Rubini che dopo il successo di “Delitto e Castigo” scandaglieranno le oscurità del mondo attraverso un altro capolavoro della letteratura: “DRACULA” di Bram Stoker. Dai grandi classici alle nuove scritture di scena, “LA CLASSE” di Vincenzo Manna tratteggia il ritratto di un gruppo di studenti di un istituto professionale e di un professore di storia disposto a tutto pur di educare i suoi ragazzi alla difficile sfida della società multiculturale. La stagione prosegue con Anna Foglietta e Paolo Calabresi, interpreti di “BELLA FIGURA”, surreale commedia della francese Yasmine Reza che prende il via dalla gelosia di un’amante nei confronti della moglie. Grandi nomi anche per “LIBRI DA ARDERE” , unico testo teatrale di Amèlie Nothomb messo in scena dal Teatro dell’Elfo e dalla Corte Ospitale, con Elio De Capitani accompagnato da Angelo Di Genio e Carolina Cametti. Stretti nella morsa della neve in una città dell’est Europa, un professore e due giovani devono scegliere tra morire di freddo o bruciare dei libri, combattuti tra lo spirito di sopravvivenza e il rispetto per i simboli cartacei della conoscenza umana. Alessandro Haber guidato dalla regia di Leo Muscato sarà il protagonista di “MORTE DI UN COMMESSO VIAGGIATORE” , capolavoro di Arthur Miller prodotto dal Teatro Stabile di Bolzano, Goldenart e dal Teatro Stabile del Veneto. La storia del lavoratore attratto dal facile guadagno e dal miraggio del successo che continua a risuonare fortemente nella nostra contemporaneità. Proseguendo nel filone letterario sarà poi il turno di “LO STRANO CASO DEL CANE UCCISO A MEZZANOTTE” , coproduzione del Teatro dell’Elfo e del Teatro Stabile di Torino tratto dal celebre romanzo di Mark Haddon. Il giovane Christopher, affetto dalla sindrome di Asperger, si troverà a indagare sull’uccisione del cane della sua vicina, aprendo un’emozionante finestra sulla vita di chi vede il mondo in maniera un po’ diversa. A chiudere la programmazione Andrea Castelli, nome più che amato in tutta la regione e oltre, accompagnato dalle musiche live di Emanuele Dell’Aquila, guiderà il suo pubblico in un viaggio della memoria con “LA MERAVIGLIA. Voci e storie della città sotterranea” . Una produzione del Teatro Stabile di Bolzano che guarda al passato senza amara nostalgia, ma con il gusto di guardarsi indietro e riconoscersi accomunati dalle stesse storie.; Citando una vecchia pubblicità di Carosello, l’indimenticato Ernesto Calindri – storica figura del teatro italiano – sosteneva che contro il logorio della vita moderna fosse sufficiente ricorrere ad un superalcolico al carciofo. La nuova Stagione del Centro Servizi Culturali S. Chiara, invece, per tentare di far fronte alle difficoltà e alle contraddizioni del contemporaneo, propone al proprio pubblico un potente rimedio: il teatro, mai come in questo momento specchio che riflette le contraddizioni dell’oggi, aprendo gli occhi al loro auspicabile superamento.; Anche la stagione Altre Tendenze, dopo essere iniziata con lo spettacolo dedicato alla tragedia di Stava, prosegue con titoli di grande richiamo che attraversano più di duemila anni di storia del teatro. A calcare per prima il palco del Teatro Sociale sarà la compagnia veneta Anagoor con il grandioso affresco classico “ORESTEA” , tratto dalla trilogia di Eschilo con la regia di Simone Derai. Coprodotto da Centrale Fies, il trittico racconta la vicenda degli Atridi e la scia di sangue scatenata dalla Guerra di Troia, mescolando l’epica antica con i moderni riti funebri. A seguire, il grande teatro di narrazione di Marco Baliani con “UNA NOTTE SBAGLIATA” accompagnerà il pubblico di Trento in un emozionante viaggio nella coscienza umana. Il caso di cronaca di un senzatetto picchiato da alcuni poliziotti e la violenza di cui lo stesso Baliani è stato testimone diventano occasione per riflettere sulle zone oscure dell’uomo. Ugualmente profondo, ma irresistibilmente ironico e pungente, “OVERLOAD” dei Sotterraneo è uno spettacolo interattivo che si diverte a mettere alla prova l’attenzione del pubblico, vincitore del Premio Ubu come migliore spettacolo del 2018. L’anno nuovo inizia con alcune giovani compagnie italiane particolarmente amate da pubblico e critica. In “CUORE DI CANE” , la barese Licia Lanera si ispira alla cupa storia del russo Michail Bulgakov per portare sul palco dell’Auditorium Melotti di Rovereto il mito della bellezza e dell’eterna giovinezza, grandi ossessioni della società contemporanea. A febbraio sarà invece Stefano Cordella, alla guida della compagnia Oyes, a emozionare il pubblico di Trento e Rovereto. “IO NON SONO UN GABBIANO” secondo capitolo del dittico cechoviano, rilegge il grande classico del maestro del teatro russo per scoprire quanto ancora di vero c’è nell’urlo di ribellione dei figli nei confronti dei padri. Tra i due spettacoli, la figura di un grande maestro del teatro contemporaneo. “THE NIGHT WRITER” è un viaggio intimo e prezioso nella vita di Jan Fabre, artista fiammingo tra i grandi protagonisti della scena internazionale. A dare corpo alle parole di Fabre il giovane talento italiano Lino Musella. La stagione proseguirà con Alessandro Bergonzoni e il suo ultimo lavoro “TRASCENDI E SALI” . Nel più puro stile bergonzoniano, tra comicità e rigore, l’artista bolognese invita il pubblico a seguirlo in una tagliente riflessione sul presente. Dalla surrealtà al risorgimento, “VÁ PENSIERO” del Teatro delle Albe accompagna il pubblico del Teatro Sociale alla scoperta di una storia vera in grado di farsi parabola dei nostri tempi. In Emilia Romagna un poliziotto viene licenziato perché ha denunciato alcuni atti illeciti legati alla mafia. Ermanna Montanari e Marco Martinelli, con il Coro da Camera del Conservatorio di Trento, si ispirano alla musica di Giuseppe Verdi per parlare di democrazia, giustizia e speranza. A chiudere la stagione Altre Tendenze, la nuova produzione della compagnia teatrale trentina Emit Flesti “JACQUES E IL SUO PADRONE” . Unica opera teatrale di Milan Kundera, la commedia è un esplicito omaggio a Denis Diderot e vede protagonisti un nobile francese e il suo valletto che discutono di amore tra avventure, tradimenti e scherzi, celebrando quell’allegria che può salvare dal buio della storia.; Per quanto riguarda la proposta di abbonamento alla Grande Prosa, i prezzi previsti per la nuova Stagione oscillano tra 40 e 175 Euro, con la consueta vantaggiosa proposta “su misura” per il sabato sera (da 35 a 160 euro). Confermata la “Card Grande Prosa”: 5 spettacoli a scelta tra i 10 della Grande Prosa, al costo di 120 Euro, con una riduzione dedicata ai giovani (Under 26) al prezzo di 40 Euro. Per gli abbonati sono inoltre previsti particolari benefit: al costo di 2,50 euro potranno essere acquistati fino a 5 biglietti di stagioni prosa “partner”: 1 biglietto della stagione del Teatro Stabile di Bolzano, 2 della rassegna “Altre Tendenze Trento e Rovereto”, 2 della rassegna “inDanza Trento e Bolzano”, più la possibilità di acquistare 1 biglietto da 10 Euro per lo spettacolo «Anna dei Miracoli». L’acquisto dell’abbonamento alla stagione di Grande Prosa darà inoltre diritto al “ridotto giovani” per l’acquisto di tutti i biglietti ovvero dell’abbonamento alla rassegna Altre Tendenze. Sono infine previste ulteriori riduzioni per gli enti convenzionati.; Vantaggiose anche le condizioni di abbonamento alla rassegna Altre Tendenze. L’abbonamento a 10 spettacoli avrà un costo tra i 45 e gli 80 euro, con la possibilità di poterne sottoscrivere uno ai soli spettacoli di Trento o Rovereto, al costo di 50 Euro (con eventuali riduzioni).; Si ricorda inoltre che sarà possibile rinnovare gli abbonamenti, sia Grande Prosa che Altre Tendenze, da sabato 7 a mercoledì 25 settembre 2019 (cambio turno/posto 26 e 27 settembre). La sottoscrizione dei nuovi abbonamenti, invece, partirà sabato 28 settembre 2019. Gli abbonamenti saranno acquistabili presso le casse del Teatro Auditorium (lun-sab, 10-19), del Teatro Sociale (lun-sab, 16-19). I biglietti per la Grande Prosa e per le Altre Tendenze saranno invece acquistabili a partire da sabato 26 ottobre 2019. I biglietti saranno in vendita anche sul sito www.primiallaprima.it; Proseguono gli appuntamenti con i FOYER DELLA PROSA, grazie alla rinnovata collaborazione tra il Centro Servizi Culturali S. Chiara e il Dipartimento di Lettere e Filosofia dell’Università di Trento.

"Corso di sogno lucido e consapevolezza onirica","€80","Sognare sapendo di sognare, dirigere i sogni, usarli per varcare i limiti del noto ed esplorare le profondità della mente. Tutto ciò non rappresenta un’abilità paranormale, ma un fenomeno noto a molte culture e recentemente scoperto dalla scienza. È una potenzialità che abbiamo tutti e che può essere sviluppata attraverso semplici pratiche.; In 4 sabati, a cominciare dal 16/11, imparerai a coltivare livelli crescenti di consapevolezza onirica attraverso un percorso che integra diversi approcci e tradizioni, tra cui le indagini scientifiche di Stephen LaBerge, lo yoga tibetano de sogno, le ricerche di Carlos Castaneda e la tradizione teosofica.; Si comincia con un approfondimento del fenomeno del sonno e delle sue fasi, che permetterà di migliorare la qualità del riposo e sviluppare la capacità di ricordare nitidamente i sogni. Su questa base impareremo ad applicare le tecniche che permettono di fare sogni lucidi, ossia riconoscere i sogni nel momento in cui sorgono e dirigerli consapevolmente. Verranno anche esplorate alcune tecniche che consentono di entrare nella dimensione onirica senza soluzione di continuità con lo stato di veglia, accedendo ai fenomeni noti come “viaggi astrali” o “esperienze fuori dal corpo”.; Al di là del grande senso di gioia e libertà che queste esperienze regalano, lo sviluppo della consapevolezza onirica dischiude un campo di esperienza virtualmente inesauribile, che permette di esplorare i livelli più profondi della mente, confrontarsi con i propri lati d’ombra, contattare le proprie risorse interiori, liberarsi dai condizionamenti e, secondo alcune tradizioni, addirittura accedere a dimensioni diverse da quella fisica ma altrettanto reali.; Oltre alle spiegazioni teoriche, il corso include esercitazioni pratiche, momenti di condivisione, materiali di approfondimento e colloqui individuali per ricevere istruzioni personalizzate sulla pratica.; La prima parte del corso prevede due incontri, che si terranno sabato 16 e sabato 30 novembre, dalle 10 alle 18. La seconda parte del corso si svolgerà tra gennaio e febbraio 2020.

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-2","2019-12-2","9:30","17:00",,,,,

Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-5","2019-12-5","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Wildlife",,"At the MUSE Science museum in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor Jürgen Lingl-Rebetez. The author, employing an unusual wood carving technique with the almost exclusive use of a chainsaw, creates hyperrealistic wooden works, depicting animal species, many of which are at risk of extinction. More than 30 sculptures - including monumental ones - will be collected in four thematic groups:  next to the wild pantheon of the Great Carnivores are groups of Arctic species, temperate environments and - finally - a corner where the author gives his artistic and passionate tribute to the horse, an animal which is certainly not threatened, but that is slowly being forgotten, after being a key element of history.(Translation by Denis Cova, Sophie M.

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-7","2019-12-7","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-9","2019-12-9","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-21","2019-12-21","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-23","2019-12-23","9:30","17:00",,,,,

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-25","2019-12-25","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-28","2019-12-28","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2019-12-30","2019-12-30","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2020-1-1","2020-1-1","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2020-1-4","2020-1-4","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals","free admission"," Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.'Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals' is a collection of large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms. . Plankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.. Presented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.. Movements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.. Current scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source: https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/633441",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Buonconsiglio%20Castle",,"2020-1-6","2020-1-6","9:30","17:00",,,,,

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"Wildlife",,"At the MUSE Science museum in Trento the first Italian exhibition by the German sculptor Jürgen Lingl-Rebetez.

More than 30 sculptures - including monumental ones - will be collected in four thematic groups:  next to the wild pantheon of the Great Carnivores are groups of Arctic species, temperate environments and - finally - a corner where the author gives his artistic and passionate tribute to the horse, an animal which is certainly not threatened, but that is slowly being forgotten, after being a key element of history.(Translation by Denis Cova, Sophie M.

"The sacred and the everyday. The late antique village in San Martino ai Campi ",,"In a strategic position along what in ancient times were important roads of communication - which were attended since protohistory - the archaeological site of San Martino ai Campi is characterized by significant structures of Roman and medieval age.In the period of transition between these two eras, in the fourth century AD, a village was built on the southern side of the mountain, probably for military purposes. About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by Achillina Granata of Archeogeo, and Cristina Dal Rì and Nicoletta Pisu of the Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours of the exhibition On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapanà (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director)..

"100 Marks - Berlin 2019","free admission","Tommaso Bonaventura – 100 marchi – Berlino 2019 (100 Marks - Berlin 2019) is an artistic project by the photographer Tommaso Bonaventura, developed in collaboration with the curator Elisa Del Prete, marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall (9 November 1989). The exhibition tells the story of the Begrüßungsgeld, the ‘welcome money’ which from 1970 to December 1989 was given to citizens of the DDR on entering West Germany for the first time. This vicissitude provides food for thought on an epochal change, starting from a stance that favours private, family stories, expressed through a two-sided narrative: both photographic and video.The exhibition is the upshot of collaboration between various institutions and will tour between various venues: in Turin, in Trento, and at San Vito al Tagliamento.Source: http://camera.to/en/mostre/tommaso-bonaventura-100-marchi-berlino-2019/","https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/content/view/full/631981",,,,"http://www.semanticweb.org/facilitiesEventsOntology/Trento%2C%20%2C%20Trentino%20history%20museum%20foundation%2C%20the%20Tunnels%20of%20Piedicastello%20-%20Trento",,"2020-1-16","2020-1-16","9:00","18:00",,,,,
