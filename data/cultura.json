It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers. As a result, the interaction between image and word helps us to reflect even more on the relationship between man and nature.As Henry David Thoreau used to say: \"The perception of beauty is a moral test\".",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers. As a result, the interaction between image and word helps us to reflect even more on the relationship between man and nature.As Henry David Thoreau used to say: \"The perception of beauty is a moral test\".",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

The exhibition consists of a series of images (more than 3,000 shots) obtained by placing a camera in Madonna di Campiglio, on a terrace overlooking the Brenta Dolomites, with a portion of the view between the Sella mountaintop and the Tosa mountaintop, with view on the Brentei and Bocca di Brenta mountain huts.Terri Maffei Gueret could take these photos with careful and constant presence over a period of 13 month, thanks to the equipment placed on the spot by photographer Luca Chist\u00e8.From a conceptual point of view, the project relates two distinct temporal scales: the eternal one of nature - from which the title of the exhibition - changeable in appearance, but immutable in substance, and the the limited and ephemeral\u00a0temporal scale of human experience.The lights, the atmospheres, the colours, the relationship between sky and earth, vary so much that this surprising transformation, diluted in the thousands of images collected, ends up revealing itself, making us reflect on the meaning of things and nature. An extraordinary magic of vision.To accompany the vision of these images, Terri Maffei Gueret has searched for and collected some aphorisms on the topic, as well as some texts from books by great mountaineers. As a result, the interaction between image and word helps us to reflect even more on the relationship between man and nature.As Henry David Thoreau used to say: \"The perception of beauty is a moral test\".",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let\u2019s stop thinking \u201cit\u2019s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world\u201d! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to \u2018return\u2019 art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message.

The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.

Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let\u2019s stop thinking \u201cit\u2019s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world\u201d! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to \u2018return\u2019 art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message. To the artists the task of speaking of great challenges. To the organizers, the Opera Campana dei Caduti Foundation and AIAPI, the complex but very interesting task of involving the best proposals among the many great talents from all over the world.Source:\u00a0http://aiapi.it/clima-eng\u00a0",

Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let\u2019s stop thinking \u201cit\u2019s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world\u201d! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to \u2018return\u2019 art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message. To the artists the task of speaking of great challenges. To the organizers, the Opera Campana dei Caduti Foundation and AIAPI, the complex but very interesting task of involving the best proposals among the many great talents from all over the world.Source:\u00a0http://aiapi.it/clima-eng\u00a0"

                "description": "\u00a0Mandy Barker is an international award-winning photographer whose work involving marine plastic debris over the past 10 years has received global recognition. Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.\"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals\" is a collection of\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\u00a0\nPlankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.\"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals\" is a collection of\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\u00a0\nPlankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton.

In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.

Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter.

Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.

The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let\u2019s stop thinking \u201cit\u2019s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world\u201d! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to \u2018return\u2019 art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter.

Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children.

Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest.

Working with scientists she aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution in the world's oceans whilst highlighting the harmful affect on marine life and ultimately ourselves.\"Beyond Drifting: imperfectly known animals\" is a collection of\u00a0large-format images depicting particles similar to marine microorganisms.\u00a0\nPlankton form a diverse group of microscopic marine organisms living in the water column, not able to swim against the current they exist in a drifting, floating state. In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source:\u00a0https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt  ",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source:\u00a0https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt  "

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let\u2019s stop thinking \u201cit\u2019s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world\u201d! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0"

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source:\u00a0https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt  ",

Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history.

The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade.

More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply?

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let\u2019s stop thinking \u201cit\u2019s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world\u201d! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to \u2018return\u2019 art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message. To the artists the task of speaking of great challenges. To the organizers, the Opera Campana dei Caduti Foundation and AIAPI, the complex but very interesting task of involving the best proposals among the many great talents from all over the world.Source:\u00a0http://aiapi.it/clima-eng\u00a0",

As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let\u2019s stop thinking \u201cit\u2019s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world\u201d! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest. Art, with its great power helps us to reflect and act, is made clear and direct, accessible to everyone. This is the primary objective of AIAPI, which intends to \u2018return\u2019 art to the people, who now can live it with greater relaxation, with more intense involvement so as to feel part of a larger message. To the artists the task of speaking of great challenges. To the organizers, the Opera Campana dei Caduti Foundation and AIAPI, the complex but very interesting task of involving the best proposals among the many great talents from all over the world.Source:\u00a0http://aiapi.it/clima-eng\u00a0"

Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own.

It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world\u2019s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.\nAffordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. Climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.\nTo strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in Paris, which went into force in November of 2016. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. As of April 2018, 175 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.\u201d\nAIAPI and Fondazione Campana dei Caduti intend to focus the 2019 edition of \u201cHUMAN RIGHTS?\u201d on this great problem that, for everybody, from a problem must become a solution.The world belongs to all the people who live in it and will inhabit it and we all have enormous responsibilities for the future that we will leave to our children. We are all called to act, and act quickly, to change our habits. Let\u2019s stop thinking \u201cit\u2019s not what I do in my small behaviour that pollutes the world\u201d! Everyone, always, everywhere, we are all responsible.\nArt can do a lot in this sense: it has the power to communicate with everyone, overcoming any barrier; has the strength to transmit strong images that anyone can understand; has the power to force us to reflect because if the narrative occupies relative spaces in the memory of the people, what instead passes through the view remains much more imprinted and is deposited in the conscience, even if unconsciously. More and more people are organizing to protest and raise awareness of society and those who govern us on these issues, on the extreme urgency of a change of course. Simply? We Artists are among those who want to warn of danger.\nWhat artists are invited to do, therefore, is to shake up and invite them to reflect! HUMAN RIGHTS? by its very nature, it has always had this vocation to positive and proactive provocation, because even in this edition of this we are dealing with: provoking and being proactive at the same time, so as to shake people\u2019s sensitivity with even intense vibrations, while transmitting at the same time a message and an invitation to \u201ctogether we can.\u201dHUMAN RIGHTS? #CLIMA is a complex edition and AIAPI is aware that, as always, the artists know how to surprise with ideas that only creativity and freedom of thought can suggest.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0"

The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'. The book uniquely captures our changing times along with both past and present research.Source:\u00a0https://www.mandy-barker.com/beyond-drifting-alt  ",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter.

Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

More than 30 sculptures - including monumental ones - will be collected in four thematic groups:\u00a0\u00a0next to the wild pantheon of the Great Carnivores are groups of Arctic species, temperate environments and - finally - a corner where the author gives his artistic and passionate tribute to the horse, an animal which is certainly not threatened, but that\u00a0is slowly being forgotten, after being a key element of history.(Translation by Denis Cova, Sophie M.

In this series unique 'specimens' of this animal species relate to the pioneering discoveries made by John Vaughan Thompson in Cobh, Cork harbour during the 1800's.\nPresented as microscopic samples, objects of marine plastic debris, recovered from the same location, mimic Thompson's early scientific discoveries of plankton. The work represents the degradation and contamination of plastic particles in the natural environment, by creating the perception of past scientific studies, when organisms were free from plastic. Enveloping black space evokes the deep oceans beneath. Presenting new 'specimens' created from recovered debris, serves as a metaphor to the ubiquity of plastic and the anthropocene, encapsulating in miniature the much larger problem of an imperfect world.\nMovements of the recovered plastic objects, recorded in camera over several seconds, represent the movement of individual plankton in the water column, which also parallels with the planets that have an apparent motion of their own. Captured on expired film and with faulty cameras, highlights the 'imperfection' in both technique and of subject matter. Film grain has intentionally been made visible, as a metaphor to the micro plastic particles being ingested. Nomenclature is the description given to devising new scientific names, of which each specimen has been given, imitating early latin origins, each name contains the word 'plastic' hidden within its title.\nCurrent scientific research has found that plankton ingest micro plastic particles, mistaking them for food, and at the botom of the food chain they are themselves a crucial source of food for many of the larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately man itself is currently of vital concern. In terms of plankton, and of action, we are 'Beyond Drifting', and must bring into focus these \"Imperfectly Known Animals'.The series of work is presented as an old science book from 1800's, that as well as reflecting the current situation regarding organisms intake of plastic, also subtly includes the original writing, descriptions, and figures recorded by Thompson in his research memoirs of 1830, entitled, 'Imperfectly Known Animals'.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

More than 30 sculptures - including monumental ones - will be collected in four thematic groups:\u00a0\u00a0next to the wild pantheon of the Great Carnivores are groups of Arctic species, temperate environments and - finally - a corner where the author gives his artistic and passionate tribute to the horse, an animal which is certainly not threatened, but that\u00a0is slowly being forgotten, after being a key element of history.(Translation by Denis Cova, Sophie M.

About two hundred years later, a fire destroyed a large part of the village, which, however, continued to live, also thanks to Christian devotion.To celebrate the 50th anniversary since finding this archaeological site in 1969, the finds and structures of this village have been reassembled. As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0",

As a result, here's an exhibition featuring a recount of daily aspects which are often in relation to sacred ones: kitchen, house, daily activities, commerce, personal objects are presented along with finds pertaining to specific cults that took place in the sanctuary in the first centuries AD.In short, the exhibition offers a glance at a particular moment in the life of\u00a0Monte San Martino ai Campi, while waiting for in-depth studies to be carried out.Exhibition curated by\u00a0Achillina Granata of Archeogeo,\u00a0and Cristina Dal R\u00ec and Nicoletta Pisu of the\u00a0Archaeological Heritage Office of the Department for Cultural Heritage of the Autonomous Province of Trento.Guided tours\u00a0of the exhibition\u00a0On Sunday 13 and Sunday 27 October 2019 it will be possible to join a free guided tour of the exhibition at 11.00, held by Matteo Rapan\u00e0 (MAG Museo Alto Garda museum director).\nInformation\nwww.museoaltogarda.it\nwww.cultura.trentino.it/Temi/Archeologiawww.archeosanmartino.it\u00a0"
